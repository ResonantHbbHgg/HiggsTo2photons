# You can take an example opttree from my public area.
# Otherwise a custom optree can be done running the code available in h2gglobe:
# look at AnalysisScripts/massfac_mva_binned/datafiles_optree.dat for an example.
# If you split the files for different samples you have to hadd them and 
# finally you can run the merger.C macro (in UCSDPlotter) to produce the final tree
